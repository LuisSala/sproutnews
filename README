TODO: Describe Your Project

Basic news reader with touch gesture support.

Retrieves JSON feed from a Yahoo! Pipe and displays in a custom ListView wrapped inside a ScrollView.

Double-clicking/tapping on a news item opens a Panel containing the content which, in this case, is passed through
a Readability server written in Node.JS.
